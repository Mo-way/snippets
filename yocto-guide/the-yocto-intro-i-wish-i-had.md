Trying to work with Yocto, while relying mainly on trial-and-error, Google or ChatGPT will be a waste of your time.
You have to understand some concepts first, e.g. by reading documentation, reading Stackoverflow  or trying out simple examples.

The [What I wish Iâ€™d known about Yocto Project](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev/singleindex.html#what-i-wish-i-d-known-about-yocto-project) section 
is good. But if you ask me, it only makes sense, *once you already understand how Yocto works* - Oh the irony.


The hard question is: how to do better? I'll start by listing the tools and methods I use when trying to figure out something about a Yocto issue. Not all of them can be used productively at first, find your own pace.

1. single index docs https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev/singleindex.html# (bookmarked, dev -> own ycoto version)
2. layer index / recipe index
3. grep and find inside meta-poky and meta-oe
4. 




Things to understand
- Good one
